# her-data
HER data for Lincoln

You can use config_liverpool.sh to build Arches (setup_db, load RDM concepts, collections, and the HER branches/models), and also load a series of overlays for Arches.

After running config_liverpool.sh, you can run config_import_liverpool.sh to load business data into Arches.

You'll want to run both scripts from your Arches virtual environment!
